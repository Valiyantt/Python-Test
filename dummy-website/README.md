# Dummy Website

Small static website scaffold for demos and testing.

Quick start (from the `dummy-website` folder):

```bash
# using Python 3 built-in server
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — simple styling
- `script.js` — small client-side interactivity

Feel free to copy or modify this scaffold for your own tests.
